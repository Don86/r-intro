# Introduction to R

These are the course notes for the "Introduction to R" course given by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform on the 30th of November 2015.

R is both a programming language and interactive environment for statistics. Today we will be concentrating on R as an *interactive environment*.

We will be covering:

* working with R data types
* summarizing data in matrices and data frames
* plotting
* for-loops for repetitive tasks
