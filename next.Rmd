# Next steps

We can barely touch the surface of what R has to offer today. If you want to take your skills to the next level, here are some topics to investigate:

Programming:

* Writing functions.

Tidying and summarizing data:

* dplyr, plyr, and tidyr packages by Hadley Wickham.
* magrittr's `%>%` operator for chaining together data frame manipulations.

Data visualization:

* ggplot2 for general plotting.

Statistics:

* Many statistical tests are built in to R.
* Linear models and the linear model formula syntax `~`.
  * Many statistical techniques take linear models as their starting point, including `edgeR` which we will be using to test for differential gene expression.
  * Many R function repurpose the `~` formula syntax for other ways of relating response and explanatory variables.

RNA-Seq:

* This will be covered in the Thursday class.
