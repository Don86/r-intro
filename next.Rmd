# Next steps

We HAVE barely touchED the surface of what R has to offer today. If you want to take your skills to the next level, here are some topics to investigate:

### Programming:

* Writing functions.
* Using if statements.

The [Software Carpentry in R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) course introduces R as a programming language.

### Tidying and summarizing data:

* [plyr](http://plyr.had.co.nz/), [dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html),  and [tidyr](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/) packages by Hadley Wickham.
* [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html)'s `%>%` operator for chaining together data frame manipulations.

### Statistics:

* Many statistical tests are built in to R.
* Linear models and the linear model formula syntax `~`.
    * Many statistical techniques take linear models as their starting point, including `edgeR` which we will be using to test for differential gene expression.
    * Many R function repurpose the `~` formula syntax for other ways of relating response and explanatory variables.

### RNA-Seq:

* This will be covered in the Thursday class.
