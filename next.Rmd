# Next steps

We have barely touched the surface of what R has to offer today. If you want to take your skills to the next level, here are some topics to investigate:

### Programming

* Writing functions.
* Using if statements.

The [Software Carpentry in R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) course introduces R as a programming language.

### Tidying and summarizing data

* [plyr](http://plyr.had.co.nz/), [dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html),  and [tidyr](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/07/22/introducing-tidyr/) packages by Hadley Wickham.
* [magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html)'s `%>%` operator for chaining together data frame manipulations.

These tools play well with `ggplot2`, which we saw in the previous chapter.

### Statistics

* Many statistical tests are built in to R.

* Linear models, and the linear model formula syntax `~`, are core to much of what R has to offer statistically.
    * Many statistical techniques take linear models as their starting point, including `limma` which we will be using to test for differential gene expression.
    * Many R function repurpose the `~` formula syntax for other ways of relating response and explanatory variables.

See "The R Book" by Michael J. Crawley for general reference.

The books "Linear Models with R" and "Extending the Linear Model with R" by Julian J. Faraway cover linear models, with many practical examples.

### Bioinformatics

[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) is a collection of bioinformatics related packages, including the popular `limma` and `edgeR` packages for RNA-Seq analysis developed at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute.

### Getting help

Talk to the Monash Bioinformatics Platform for help and pointers.

Stackoverflow-style sites are also great for getting help:

* [support.bioconductor.org](https://support.bioconductor.org) for bioconductor related questions.
* [biostars.org](https://biostars.org) for general bioinformatics questions.
* [stats.stackexchange.com](http://stats.stackexchange.com) for statistics questions.
* [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) for general programming questions.
